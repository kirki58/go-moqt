`model` package Provides the core MOQT protocol implementation as defined in [IETF MOQ-Transport draft 15](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-moq-transport/)

This includes: common notations, object models, error definitions etc.
Most of them are abstractions for representing QUIC wire data in a Go development environment.
